# Neural-Network-Analysis
Investigating how different neural network attributes affect the accuracy of the network against the MNIST hand drawn digit dataset

All project documentation is located in "NeuralNetworkgithub.pdf".

To recreate data set download "mnist_train.csv" and "mnist_test.csv" from https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv into the 
"FORMATTING DATASET" directory and then move the produced "numbers.pkl" file to root directory.

"main_server" begins flask server on local host.

Program running and testing can be seen "https://youtu.be/5aFUpevWEYU".
